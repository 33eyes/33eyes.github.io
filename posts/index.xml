      <description>Since November 2017, Wikipedia has been regularly releasing monthly clickstream datasets that capture summarized page-to-page user visits to Wikipedia articles. This clickstream data is a record of how we browse Wikipedia.
The Wikipedia clickstream datasets consist of aggregated records of clickstream events. A clickstream event occurs when a user goes from one webpage to another. In the data, it is logged as a data row containing the source webpage, called a referer, the destination webpage, called a resource, the type of the reference, and the total count of times users went from the referer to the reference in a given month.</description>

      <description>My first week at Metis has just breezed by. While I am not new to data analytics and statistics, I am new to data science and Python. For me, this past week has been a mix of a few things old and familiar, and a lot of things new and surprising. We&amp;rsquo;ve covered lots of introductory grounds on Git and GitHub, pair programming, Pandas, complexity, Matplotlib, command line basics, Seaborn, and, of course, many more Python topics.</description>
